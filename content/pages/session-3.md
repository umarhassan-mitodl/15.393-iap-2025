## Part 2: Organizational and People Issues

Most ventures which fail do so because of people issues, not technology, market, or funding issues. What people are needed to take an idea and make it a reality? How do you identify good team members and avoid problems? We will discuss building both external and internal teams, and developing and implementing a philosophy for the business. This session will tackle such questions as: 

- In a world that seems focused on advancement via technology, how important is it to build a top-quality team?
- Do you have a story about when you made a really good hire?
- How about one where you did this badly?
- What were the key differences between the good hires and the bad hires?
- How has this changed your approach to interviewing for new hires? Are you better at hiring?
- How do you keep your team focused and motivated? How do you motivate, recognize and reward top performance?
- What about firing? Have you ever done it? What can you share about that experience?
- What are the pros and cons of issuing stock/options and how does that affect the culture of the company you're building?

We will discuss "People Issues" with a panel assembled by Vivian Vitale:
