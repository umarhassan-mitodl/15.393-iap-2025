## Part 1: Financing Sources Panel

You have identified the product/service and the market. You have settled on a business model and have done your financial projections.  How will you finance the plan?

This session will cover: Bootstrapping the early stages. Funding from the 3 F's- Friends, Family and Fools.Angels- who are they and what are they looking for?  Private placements.   Customer financing.  Government grants (e.g., SBIRs).   Consulting- getting someone else to pay for the development, provide a beta site and endorse your idea.  Venture capital.   Bank financing.

You will learn about the institutional constraints and needs of various funding sources. As a result you will be in a better position to determine if, when, and how to approach these sources for financing.

This part of the program will feature a panel of experts discussing different financing sources.
