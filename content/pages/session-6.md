## Part 1: Why Do You Want to Be an Entrepreneur?

Why do this? You have seen the first five evenings of this course, and seen all the skills you will need to have or acquire in your team. There are many moving pieces. Do you really want to do this, and if so, what do you need to prepare yourself for personally?

In this session, Bob Jones will talk about some of the heart-breaking experiences that entrepreneurs have described to him and will explore some of the rarely discussed emotional turmoil that's a part of this life. He will also share the rewards that offset those negatives and keep these entrepreneurs coming back for more. These lessons may help you through the dark days most of us have while growing a business.
